I recently learned about [Github Pages][pages] and it couldn't come at a better time. As for sometime now, I've been looking for a way to share thoughts, code, and anything I deem worthy.  

With the help of [Simon HÃ¸rup Eskildsen][sirupsen_post] and [Max Lynch][max_lynch_post] I learned enough about how Github Pages worked, like  [Jekyll][jekyll] <i>(a static site generator written in Ruby; I loved the ruby part)</i> and [Markdown][markdown] <i>(a text-to-HTML conversion tool; I was a bit skeptical about this markdown notion but it's turned out to be a good experience)</i>, that I was able to follow suit and ta-da here you have my Github Page!

While I found Jekyll to be pretty awesomely simple. It's static nature drove me to jazz up my Page a bit...so I decided to use [JQuery Mobile][jquery_mobile] to make things seem a little more dynamic and leverage it's "mobile first, not mobile only" philosophy. I then found a beautiful [JQuery Mobile Theme][jquery_mobile_theme] based on [Flat UI][flat_ui]. As for icons, I am using [Font Awesome][font_awesome] as I find the JQuery icons gallery a bit lacking.

Thank you for reading and I hope you've found something useful (if not maybe you will overtime as I share my experiences in software development).

If you have any thoughts or question you want to share with me please drop me a tweet or send an email to rafael.revi@yahoo.com

Cheers
