intro: On writing with humanity and inheritance

"Any time you can tell a story in the form of a quest or a pilgrimage....readers bearing their own associations will do some of your work for you." - William Zinsser

As a writer, don't focus on the final product. Even if you are trying to sell it. Rather, focus on finding that deeper place in your story. Tell the humanity in your story.

On template method patterns and using hooks instead of super.
