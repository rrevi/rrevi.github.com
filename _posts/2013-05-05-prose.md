Recently, I found an article by [Development Seed][development_seed] on running Jekyll based sites on your own web server. Having started to use GitHub Pages just last month, I thought it was an awesome idea to be able to develop small Jekyll based sites, update them using Git from anywhere in the world, and have the webserver recompile the site based on the commit.

After having read that article, I browsed through the Develoment Seed blog a bit and learned about [Prose][prose]. I could not believe what my eyes were seeing! A web based text editor of your GitHub account repositories! Hence we now have this post and very likely more :)

Thank you folks from Development Seed for Prose (and all the other fine open source software you've developed).
