- I start to performance test Newfound Communication's home grown products. I use **JMeter** to automate performance testing and place heavy traffic on the IP Call Recorder product GUI. I also test the performance of the GUI against **large volumes of data (100M+ database records)**.
- This year I start collaborating with the Research and Development group engineers on Perfomance Testing every aspect of the IP Call Recorder: generating traffic with **SIPp**, monitoring and optimizing the impact of large volume of data of , etc.
- I learn **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails**! I start contributing fixes and new features to the IP Call Recorder's User Dashboard.
